# SCHEDULER

# Overview

This is a scheduling app under development for a tennis club. It allows users to:

View and choose a tennis court location from the homepage.

Book a training session: After choosing a location, users can see a calendar with available dates and book a session.

View other users' bookings to avoid conflicts.

In the future, the app will include Telegram authentication for users.

# Authentication

To book a training session, users must be authenticated with their phone number.

If a user clicks on the "Book the court" button without being logged in, a modal window will appear, prompting them to authenticate by entering their name and phone number.

API for user authentication is still in the testing phase.

# Booking Details
